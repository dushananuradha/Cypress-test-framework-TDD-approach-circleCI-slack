For Unix-like env config command
 - npm install --save-dev cross-env
 - "cy:op:common": "cross-env ENV_FILE=.env cypress open"
    - cross-env will set the ENV_FILE environment variable before running the cypress run command
 - replace .env and .envUI with the actual paths

Without installing cross-env
"cy:op:setcommon": "set ENV_FILE=.env&&cypress open"
    - ENV_FILE : environment variable that is set to the name of the .env file you want to use.
    - set command: to set environment variables in Windows
    - && : to run multiple commands on the same line 

const envFolderPath = './env_files';
 - envFolderPath represents path to directory in file system
 - So './env_files' points to a directory named env_files in the same directory as the script

const envFile = process.env.ENV_FILE || '.env';
 - process.env.ENV_FILE retrieves the value of the ENV_FILE environment variable
 - If ENV_FILE, it defaults to .env

dotenv.config({ path: path.resolve(__dirname, path.join(envFolderPath, envFile)) });
 - path.join(envFolderPath, envFile) joins the envFolderPath and envFile together to create the full path to  environment file. 
 - This full path is then used by dotenv.config() to load the variables from env file into process.env

config.env = Object.assign({}, config.env, process.env);
 - merging the config.env and process.env objects into a new object and assigning it back to config.env
 - Cypress will then use updated the environment variables object when it runs.

import dbConnection from "./cypress/fixtures/dbConnection.json";
 - Added following options in "compilerOptions"
    - "esModuleInterop": true
    - "resolveJsonModule": true

Balance strategy
 - Cypress will automatically balance your spec files across the available machines in your CI provider minimizing the overall test run duration.
 - Cypress calculates which spec file to run based on the data collected from previous runs, and then, 
 - distribute spec files to available CI resources in descending order of spec run duration. 
 - the most time-consuming specs start first.
